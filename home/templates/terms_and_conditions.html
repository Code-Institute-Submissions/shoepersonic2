<p>
    Shoepersonic reserves the right to change prices for products 
    displayed on the Shoepersonic store at any time and to correct 
    pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Any price changes 
    will not affect an order that has already been accepted by

    you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the 
    transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no 
    cost to you.  
</p>
<h2>Product Packaging</h2>
<p>
    Some of the products we stock are supplied sealed in packaging 
    and therefore you may receive an item as part of your order that
     has previously been opened. We will occasionally open sealed
      packaging in order to photograph products or spot check
       quality control. Unless otherwise stated we guarantee all 
       products you receive as part of your order are brand new 
       and unused.  
</p>

<p>
    Within a few hours after we receive your order, we’ll 
    email you an order confirmation that your order has been received. 
    As with the order number, 
    the order confirmation email does not signify our acceptance 
    of your order; we are simply confirming that we received 
    your order. Once we have processed your order and prepared 
    it for shipping, we will send you an email stating that we 
    have accepted your order, which will include the shipment 
    details. The decision to accept your order is in our sole 
    discretion. Because we want to make sure that we have your 
    product available, we won’t accept your order until we have 
    prepared your product for shipping. In most cases, this will 
    be within twenty-four hours for products that are in stock.
