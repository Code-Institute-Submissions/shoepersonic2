    <h1>About us</h1>

        <h2>What we do</h2>
        <p>Shoepersonic is a site dedicated to trying out running shoes. Every season we'll concentrate on a particular type of shoe. We'll
             buy a selection of models, run in them and tell you what we think on YouTube. You can then make an informed decision about which one to buy.
        </p>
    </div>

        <h2>Our Reviews</h2>
        <p>Ultimately a shoe is a shoe. It's not going to fly you to the moon. When doing our reviews, I have a decent run in the shoe and then 
            talk about how it feels to run in. You can probably tell it is completely unscripted. If any feature makes a difference to that experience,
             I'll mention it. If it doesn't I won't.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we review shoes, we do want you to buy them. If we buy a shoe and don't like it we won't sell it. But each shoe we test, we try and 
            think about the features that make it better for a particular type of runner or another. We'll always focus on the positives and if we 
            haven't got anything nice to say we won't say anything.

            <img class="rounded" src="media/about_us/harry_founder.png" alt="Harry the Founder" style="width: 20rem;">
            <p class="py-3">I love running. Like many people working who work in London I avoid the tube and run into work 
                and as much as I can during the week. Then at the weekend I do a Park run and a nice long run in the countryside. I've always found buying 
                running shoes on the internet very convenient but also stressful. Descriptions are always full of marketing jargon, but never 
                talk about what they are like to run in.

            <h4>Louis, Co-Founder</h4>
            <p class="py-3">
            My younger brother Louis describes himself as a fair weather middle distance runner.
            He'll turn on to a park run on Saturday and obliterate the field and is responsible for more of my PBs than I can count. 
            He helps out with everything to do with the running of our website.

            <p class="py-3">Robbie studied Zoology at university and loves filming wildlife. He also does pet portraiture. He's exceptionally
                skilled and knowledgable, and a complete perfectionist and if you want to see more go to <a href="http://robbieharman.com">robbieharman.com</a>.

            <p class="py-3">We do all our our own photography which means some poor guy has to position themselves 
                in awkward places to get us the best shot. That poor guy is Luke, civil engineer by day,
                photographer by night.

        <h2>Running Clubs</h2>
        <p>Running clubs are the foundation of the running community in the UK. Every single weekend, when the rest of the country is in bed, there is 
            an army of people (usually volunteers) opening the track, laying out cones or tying tape to trees. When we set up Shoepersonic, we 
            wanted to show our appreciation for these people and we do that by donating a percentage of our profits to them. When you buy shoes 
            from us you'll be asked to type in your running club. At the end of the year, we then donate 5% of the profits from that sale to that club.
             Just our way of saying thank you.
