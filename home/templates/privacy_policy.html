<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Personal information is data that can be used to identify or 
    contact a single person.
</p>
<p>
    You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime 
    you are in contact with Shoepersonic. We use this information 
    to provide and improve our products, services, content, and 
    advertising. You are not required to provide the personal 
    information that we have requested, but, if you chose not to 
    do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with 
    our products or services or respond to any queries you may have.    
</p>
<p>
    Here are some examples of the types of personal information 
    Shoepersonic may collect and how we may use it:
</p>
<h3>What personal information we collect</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When you create an account, contact us or participate in an 
        online survey, we may collect a variety of information, 
        including your name, mailing address, phone number, email 
        address, contact preferences, and credit card information. 
    </li>
    <li>
        When you share products with family and friends, or send gift 
        certificates, Shoepersonic may collect the information you 
        provide about those people such as name, mailing address, 
        phone number, and email address.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>How we use your personal information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The personal information we collect allows us to keep you 
        posted on Shoepersonic’s latest product announcements, and 
        upcoming events. If you don’t want to be on our mailing list, 
        you can opt out anytime by updating your account.
    </li>
    <li>
        We also use personal information to help us create, 
        develop, operate, deliver, and improve our products, 
        services, content and advertising, and for loss prevention 
        and anti-fraud purposes.  
    </li>
    <li>
        From time to time, we may use your personal information 
        to send important notices, such as communications about 
        purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. 
        Because this information is important to your interaction with 
        Shoepersonic, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.  
    </li>
    <li>
        We may also use personal information for internal purposes 
        such as auditing, data analysis, and research to improve 
        Shoepersonic’s products, services, and customer communications.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion 
        we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.      
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    We also collect data in a form that does not, on its own, 
    permit direct association with any specific individual. We may 
    collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information 
    for any purpose. The following is an example of non-personal 
    information that we collect and how we may use it: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We may collect information regarding customer activities 
        on our website and from our other products and services. 
        This information is aggregated and used to help us provide 
        more useful information to our customers and to understand 
        which parts of our website, products, and services are of most 
        interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal 
        information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If we do combine non-personal information with personal information 
    the combined information will be treated as personal information for as 
    long as it remains combined.
</p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p>
    Shoepersonic’s website, online services, interactive 
    applications, email messages, and advertisements may use 
    “cookies” and other technologies such as pixel tags and web 
    beacons. These technologies help us better understand user 
    behaviour, tell us which parts of our website people have 
    visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of 
    advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected 
    by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. 
    However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses 
    or similar identifiers are considered personal information by 
    local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal 
    information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal 
    information is combined with personal information, we treat 
    the combined information as personal information for the 
    purposes of this Privacy Policy. 
</p>
<p>
    Shoepersonic and our partners also use cookies and other 
    technologies to remember personal information when you use 
    our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in 
    these cases is to make your experience with Shoepersonic 
    more convenient and personal. For example, knowing your 
    first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the 
    website. Knowing your country and language helps us provide 
    a customised and more useful shopping experience. Knowing 
    someone using your computer or device has shopped for a 
    certain product or used a particular service helps us make 
    our advertising and email communications more relevant to 
    your interests. And knowing your contact information, product 
    serial numbers, and information about your computer or device 
    helps us personalise your experience and provide you with 
    better customer service. 
</p>
<p>
    As is true of most websites, we gather some information 
    automatically and store it in log files. This information 
    includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and 
    language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and 
    exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
</p>
<p>
    We use this information to understand and analyse trends, 
    to administer the site, to learn about user behaviour on the 
    site, and to gather demographic information about our user 
    base as a whole. Shoepersonic may use this information in 
    our marketing and advertising services.   
</p>
<p>
    In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” 
    linked to content on the Shoepersonic website. When customers 
    click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server 
    before arriving at the destination page on our website. We 
    track this click-through data to help us determine interest in 
    particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer 
    communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, 
    you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages.   
</p>
<p>
    Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format 
    customers can read, and they tell us whether mail has been 
    opened. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate 
    messages sent to customers.
</p>
<h2>Disclosure to Third Parties</h2>
<p>
    At times Shoepersonic may make certain personal information 
    available to strategic partners that work with Shoepersonic to 
    provide products and services, or that help Shoepersonic market 
    to customers. Personal information will only be shared by 
    Shoepersonic to provide or improve our products, services and 
    advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their 
    marketing purposes.
</p>
<h3>What personal information we collect</h3>
<p>
    Shoepersonic shares personal information with companies 
    who provide services such as information processing, 
    extending credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering 
    products to you, managing and enhancing customer data, 
    providing customer service, assessing your interest in our 
    products and services, and conducting customer research or 
    satisfaction surveys. These companies are obligated to protect 
    your information and may be located wherever Shoepersonic operates.  
</p>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>
    It may be necessary − by law, legal process, litigation, 
    and/or requests from public and governmental authorities 
    within or outside your country of residence − for Shoepersonic 
    to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose 
    information about you if we determine that for purposes of 
    national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public 
    importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    We may also disclose information about you if we determine 
    that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms 
    and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, 
    in the event of a reorganisation, merger, or sale we may transfer 
    any and all personal information we collect to the relevant 
    third party. 
</p>
<h2>Protection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Shoepersonic takes the security of your personal information 
    very seriously. Shoepersonic’s online services protect your 
    personal information during transit using encryption such as 
    Transport Layer Security (TLS). When your personal data is 
    stored by Shoepersonic, we use computer systems with limited 
    access housed in facilities using physical security measures.    
</p>
<p>
    When you use some Shoepersonic products, services, or 
    applications the personal information you share is visible to 
    other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. 
    You are responsible for the personal information you choose 
    to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your 
    \name and email address in a product review posting, that 
    information is public. Please take care when using these features.
</p>
<h2>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Shoepersonic makes it easy for you to keep your personal 
    information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will 
    retain your personal information for the period necessary 
    to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless 
    a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.   
</p>
<h2>Access to Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    You can help ensure that your contact information and 
    preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by 
    signing in to your account. For other personal information 
    we hold, we will provide you with access for any purpose 
    including to request that we correct the data if it is 
    inaccurate or delete the data if Shoepersonic is not required 
    to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. 
    We may decline to process requests that are frivolous/vexatious, 
    jeopardise the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, 
    or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. 
    Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made through 
    the contact page.
</p>
<h2>Third Party Sites and Services</h2>
<p>
    Shoepersonic websites, products, applications, and services 
    may contain links to third party websites, products, and 
    services. Our products and services may also use or offer 
    products or services from third parties − for example, a third 
    party mobile app. Information collected by third parties, 
    which may include such things as location data or contact 
    details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage 
    you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
</p>
<h2>Privacy Questions</h2>
<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns about Shoepersonic’s 
    Privacy Policy or data processing or if you would like to 
    make a complaint about a possible breach of local privacy laws, 
    please get in touch using our contact page. 
</p>
<p>
    All such communications are examined and replies issued where 
    appropriate as soon as possible. If you are unsatisfied with 
    the reply received, you may refer your complaint to the relevant 
    regulator in your jurisdiction. If you ask us, we will 
    endeavour to provide you with information about relevant 
    complaint avenues which may be applicable to your circumstances.
</p>
<p>
    Shoepersonic may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. 
    When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be 
    posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.
