        <h2>Veteran runner Bill Phelps tries out spikes for the first time on a tough, hilly cross country race.

        </h2>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            If, like me, you thought that running spikes were solely the preserve of ‘proper grown up runners’ 
            then think again. I’m here to tell you that spikes mean much more than speed and that as an overall 
            package, they make obvious sense.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">The Race</h3>
        <p>
            I tried out spikes (a brand new pair of <a href="{% url 'shoe_detail' 4 %}">Adidas XCS</a>, courtesy of the great team at 
            Shoepersonic)  for the first time, over a 5.3 mile cross country (XC) course at Oxleas Wood 
            near Eltham in South London. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is one of the six or seven XC races forming the annual Kent Fitness League and these are 
            always enjoyable outings, well marshalled and covering a wide variety of ground conditions. Of 
            course, if autumn has done its job properly, mud, leaves and puddles are likely to be a 
            commonly recurring theme and Oxleas was true to form in most respects.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a 58 year old runner, it’s fair to say that I hail from the ‘mature’ end of the spectrum and 
            that these days I’m more built for comfort rather than speed. Yes, folks, my best times are behind 
            me but after trying out spikes, I hope like me, you’ll see that there’s more to life than dashing 
            round the course in a blur. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="pt-3">The Advantages of Spikes:</h2>
        <p>
            So, what’s to like? Well, for me, it translates in to three things:
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">1. Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            The first thing is contact. Spikes put you in touch with the ground in a way that simply eludes 
            conventional running shoes. It’s like you’ve just put your suspension in to ‘sport’ mode. Yes, 
            the ride isn’t as comfortable, but the pay back is that you know exactly what the ground’s doing 
            under your feet. If you’re still with me motoring analogy-wise, it’s like swapping cross ply 
            tyres for low profile radials. (Ok, maybe that takes some of you back just a little too far….)
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">2. Cornering</h3>
        <p>
            Secondly, cornering. This is a big one for me. Unsurprisingly, spikes provide a level of lateral 
            grip far in excess of anything even a good trail shoe can muster. This translates in to confidence, 
            on both corners and in ruts, where I have lost count of the number of times previously that 
            I’ve slithered sideways, inwards and downwards to the bottom of a muddy trail. You start out 
            gingerly, not trusting that the spikes will pull you round, but by the race halfway point, trust 
            me, you’re really starting to enjoy the twisty bits like never before.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">3. Safety and Security</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, safety, and security. If like me, you’re a tad nervous on the downhills, then fret no 
            further. Spikes love downhill work. With the weight transferred to the front, the spikes can 
            really dig in meaning you can tackle gradients with far greater aplomb - and of course, 
            speed. This also works for up-hills too – though speed here seems curiously less of a problem for me!
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, spikes can’t defy the laws of physics, deep mud will trouble them like any other shoe, 
            but remember, you can experiment with longer spike lengths and trust that, even when things get 
            really gloopy, if there’s grip to be found, they’ll find it.
        </p>
        <h3 class="pt-3">Summary</h3>
        <p>
            So, on balance, for cross country work, I’m a spikes convert. With better feel, 
            vastly improved cornering and far greater confidence on the downhills spikes add up to a 
            great package that will undoubtedly enhance your race enjoyment and, of course, your speed.
